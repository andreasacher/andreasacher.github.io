    <p class="column2">Das ist der Hauptteil des Textes. <br> invested, for possibly subversive purposes, many alarm bells began to ring. 
        When feminist cultural studies pursued this pathway, a concern to understand dynamics of power and constraint gave way to celebratory connections with the ordinary women, or indeed girls, who created their own, 
        now seemingly autonomous pleasures and rituals of enjoyable femininity 
        from the goods made available by consumer culture (e.g. television programmes like Sex and the City). If this could be done with what capitalism 
        made available, then there seemed to be no real reason to challenge the 
        principles upon which capitalism was based. Just how oppositional were 
        these seemingly subversive practices? How far did they reach? What value 
        did they deliver to women in the context of the relations of power and 
        powerlessness within which they still found themselves inscribed? How 
        did they articulate with other activities beyond the interface with popular 
        culture? My rising discomfort encompassed a number of issues. Does capitalism actually give women more or less what they want, if indeed it provides them with such cheap and available narrative pleasures, in the form 
        of popular entertainment, which also now incorporate something like a 
        feminist agenda in their plots and story lines? What need might there be 
        for a feminist politics at all, if women could simply subvert the meanings 
        of the goods and the values of the dominant cultural world around them? 
        Would this mean a suspension of the critique of capitalism, that has always 
        been such a defining feature of the tradition of socialist-feminist scholarship? This work in media and cultural studies was also far removed from 
        the earlier feminist psychoanalytically-inspired work, like that of Cora 
        Kaplan which, for example, examined in depth the complexity of being a 
        feminist reader troubled and intrigued by the fact that she found great 
        pleasure in a conservative genre of popular romances, such as The Thorn 
        Birds (Kaplan 1 986). By the turn of the century some of the strands in feminist media and cultural studies which were optimistic about the power of 
        popular feminism ran into difficulties when this gave way, to something 
        more aggressive, the mainstreaming of pornography, for example. While 
        many feminists, including myself, were never part of the pro-censorship 
        and anti-pornography campaigning back in the 1 970s and 1 980s, there was 
        nevertheless disquiet on my own part when confronted with new issues 
        such as the trend for pole-dancing being promoted as yet another form of 
        women's empowerment. It is not as though some puritanical streak buried 
        inside myself surfaces in reaction to this kind of phenomenon, it is simply 
        noticeable how little serious scholarly debate there is about what widespread participation in sex entertainment by women means for the now 
        out-of-date feminist perspectives on pornography and the sex industry 
        (McRobbie 2008)
